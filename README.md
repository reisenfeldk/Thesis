Master's Thesis: The effect of headstarting on bite force in the diamondback terrapin

Objective:
The objective of this project is to determine any differences in head morphology and bite force between headstarted and wild diamondback terrapins.  
Headstarted terrapins were raised in captivity for 9 months after being collected from in situ nests.

Code:
The project progressed by first examining with a PCA any differences between the two groups (pca.rmd).  
Second, regression analysis to examine the relationship between head width, carapace length, and bite force and construct a predictive model
for bite force (allometry.rmd).
Third, this project used historical data to examine bite force with age for headstarted and wild invididuals (ontogeny.rmd)\
Lastly, a nested approach with the two groups to examine differences in bite force (nested.rmd)

Instructions:
Data will be provided to review via email.  5 datasets that are subsetted from an initial master copy will be provided. 
Subsets were generated individually in Excel to select for individuals that met certain requirments for each analysis.  
The dataset for ontogeny only includes females where all other data sets are not exclusive.

This project was completed under Dr. Eric McElory with the College of Charleston and data was collected under Dr. Willem Roosenburg at Ohio University.

Full Abstract:
Head-starting is the captive rearing and care of animals through their juvenile life stage,
followed by release into their native habitats. The goal of head-starting programs is to avoid
high mortality of hatchlings and thus increase overall population size. Malaclemys
terrapin populations are declining throughout their range due to increased nest predation, road
mortality, habitat loss, commercial harvest for food, and bycatch in crab pots (Dorcas et al.,
2007). A M. terrapin head-starting program in Chesapeake Bay suggested that survival of headstarted
animals is lower than wild animals (Jenkins, 2018). Physiological performance may
affect an individualâ€™s ability to gain resources (Elnitsky and Claussen, 2006; Herrel et al., 2002).
Physiological performance may be different in head-started animals when compared to wild
animals, and therefore may affect survivorship. Bite force is one morphological performance
measurement that is affected by diet and corresponding head and body morphology (Herrel et al.,
2018; Marshall et al., 2012). Head-started M. terrapin are fed a soft pellet diet, which may yield
individuals with reduced bite force that are unable to forage on the hard-shelled prey accessible
to them upon release. Bite force, head, and body morphometrics were collected from M.
terrapin across all ages on Poplar Island, MD. Bite forces will be correlated to body and head
size to determine their effect across ontogeny. The force needed to crush prey items found in the
Chesapeake Bay will be obtained to determine if head-started terrapins are able to forage postrelease.
We evaluate if bite force and morphometrics are different in head-started M.
terrapin and therefore might explain the reduced survivorship of released individuals.
