Master's Thesis: The effect of headstarting on bite force in the diamondback terrapin

Objective:
The objective of this project is to determine any differences in head morphology and bite force between headstarted and wild diamondback terrapins.  
Headstarted terrapins were raised in captivity for 9 months after being collected from in situ nests.

Code:
The project progressed by first examining with a PCA any differences between the two groups (pca.rmd).  
Second, regression analysis to examine the relationship between head width, carapace length, and bite force and construct a predictive model
for bite force (allometry.rmd).
Third, this project used historical data to examine bite force with age for headstarted and wild invididuals (ontogeny.rmd)\
Lastly, a nested approach with the two groups to examine differences in bite force (nested.rmd)

Instructions:
Data will be provided to review via email.  5 datasets that are subsetted from an initial master copy will be provided. 
Subsets were generated individually in Excel to select for individuals that met certain requirments for each analysis.  
The dataset for ontogeny only includes females where all other data sets are not exclusive.

This project was completed under Dr. Eric McElory with the College of Charleston and data was collected under Dr. Willem Roosenburg at Ohio University.
